Build a Docker image
1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running
2. Create a Docker container (PowerShell): docker build -t hello-k8s:v1 .
3. Install kubectl using Chocolatey (PowerShell admin): choco install -y kubernetes-cli
4. Verify installation: kubectl version --client

Create a Kubernetes cluster
1. Create a kind cluster from the Kubernetes tab in Docker's app
2. Verify the cluster is ready, run: kubectl get nodes or kubectl logs -f hello-pod for ts
3. You can get additional information with: kubectl describe pod hello-pod
4. Deploy the pod into the cluster by running: kubectl apply -f hello-pod.yaml
5. To delete the created pod and re-deploy you can run: kubectl delete pod hello-pod
6. Test connection: kubectl port-forward hello-pod 3000:3000
NOTE: Port-foward allows a temporary connection between the local machine and the pod. 
It's useful for testing and debugging. In real life you typically use services and ingress communication.

Create pod replicas
1. Run: kubectl apply -f hello-deployment.yaml
2. Review the pods running with: kubectl get pods -w
